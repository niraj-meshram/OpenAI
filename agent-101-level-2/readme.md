# üß† Agent-101 ‚Äî Level 2: Natural-Language Due Dates (OpenAI Responses + SQLite)

Level 2 upgrades your Level 1 To-Do agent so it can understand due dates written in **natural language** (e.g., ‚Äútomorrow 5pm‚Äù, ‚Äúnext Monday 8am‚Äù), parse them into a **real timestamp**, and sort tasks by the actual time.

## üöÄ What‚Äôs new in Level 2

- ‚úÖ **Natural-language date parsing** using `dateparser`
- ‚úÖ New DB column **`due_at`** (ISO8601 datetime with timezone)
- ‚úÖ Stores both:
  - `due` ‚Üí the original text you typed
  - `due_at` ‚Üí parsed machine-readable datetime
- ‚úÖ Smarter listing: orders by `done`, then earliest `due_at`
- ‚úÖ Robust extraction: if the model passes only a single string (e.g., ‚Äúbuy milk tomorrow 5pm‚Äù), the agent **auto-extracts** the due phrase from the title

> TL;DR ‚Äî The agent now *understands time*, not just text.

## üß© Architecture snapshot


- The **Responses API** still chooses which tool to call.
- Python functions act as ‚Äútools‚Äù.
- SQLite is the persistent memory.
- Level 2 adds **date parsing** before writing to DB.

## üì¶ Requirements

Inside this project‚Äôs own virtual environment:

```bash
pip install openai dateparser pytz

setx AGENT_TIMEZONE "America/Denver"

üóÑÔ∏è Database schema (Level 2)

| column     | type    | description                        |

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run

python agent_todo.py

üîé Verify parsing in the DB (optional)

PRAGMA table_info(tasks);

SELECT id, title, due, due_at, done
FROM tasks
ORDER BY done,
         CASE WHEN due_at IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END,
         due_at ASC,
         id DESC;
